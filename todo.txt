- need to update the View available page (Show only Cars without customerID etc...)
- add constraint to sell car. (If the car is being sold/leased has customerID_FK or invoiceID_FK, then return failure)
- get rid of car invoice table (we realized we should remove it through denormalization in physical design, CAR has INVOICE ID)
- create invoice gui
- add dealership text field to add car gui
- have select dealership go back to car browsing page, with only the cars at that dealership being displayed.
- make public static variables in Main, one for currentUserID and another for currentUserType (enum)
- upon loggig in, customers are taken to the available cars page, but can press the back button to go to the employee page. If a user is a customer, remove this back button.
