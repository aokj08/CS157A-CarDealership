- need to update the View available page (Show only Cars without customerID etc...)
- add constraint to sell car. (If the car is being sold/leased has customerID_FK or invoiceID_FK, then return failure)
- get rid of car invoice table (we realized we should remove it through denormalization in physical design, CAR has INVOICE ID)
- create invoice gui
- add dealership text field to add car gui
- have selet dealership go back to car browsing page, with only the cars at that dealership being displayed.
